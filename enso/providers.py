"""
    This module provides a simple Abstract Factory-like mechanism to
    that allows for platform-specific functionalities that conform to
    common interfaces to be implemented by different libraries.

    A provider is just a Python module or package with a single
    function in it, provide_interface(), which takes a single string
    argument that corresponds to the name of an interface.  If the
    provider has an implementation of the interface, it returns it; if
    not, it returns None.

    Providers are specified as their fully-qualified module or package
    names in the enso.config.PROVIDERS list.  For instance, if the
    provider "mypackage.myprovider" should be loaded when Enso is
    started, then the string "mypackage.myprovider" should be added to
    enso.config.PROVIDERS.

    Whenever an interface implementation is requested through this
    module's get_interface() function, each provider is consulted in
    the order listed in enso.config.PROVIDERS until an implementation
    is found.  In this way, it's possible for providers to be
    "layered" (in a variation of the Chain of Responsibility pattern)
    so that Enso attempts to load the most functional and
    feature-loaded implementation first, and if that fails, Enso's
    functionality is able to "gracefully degrade" until a working
    implementation of an interface is found.

    For instance, take the hypothetical example of an interface called
    "dictionary", which has a single function, lookupWord(), that
    looks up a particular word in a dictionary and presents the
    definition to the end-user.  Under Mac OS X, the ideal
    functionality would be to use the built-in dictionary that comes
    with the operating system.  Under Windows, the ideal functionality
    would be to see if the user has some kind of offline dictionary
    program installed, and if so, to use that.  If all of these fail,
    then the final alternative would be to open the user's web browser
    and look up the word online.  Each one of these mechanisms can be
    implemented by a different provider, and as long as the "most
    generic" ones are at the end of the provider chain, Enso's
    functionality will degrade gracefully.
