"""
    This module provides access to manipulating the current selection
    on the end-user's system.

    A selection is represented by a Python dictionary-like object
    called a "Selection Dictionary", or "seldict" for short.  The keys
    in a seldict are strings that correspond to different formats that
    the current selection can be interpreted as; each value contains
    the selection in a particular format.

    The three most common formats are:

      'text'  -- Unicode text.
      'html'  -- Unicode HTML.
      'files' -- A tuple of absolute file paths.
